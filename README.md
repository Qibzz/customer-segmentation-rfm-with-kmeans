# Customer Segmentation: Optimizing Retail Strategy with AI

**Stop burning money on "one-size-fits-all" marketing.**
This project leverages Machine Learning to transform raw transaction data into actionable business strategies using **RFM Analysis** and **K-Means Clustering**.

## The Problem
Treating every customer the same leads to wasted budget and high churn rates. Businesses need to know *who* their VIPs are and *who* is about to leave.

## The Solution
Using **Python (Pandas, Scikit-Learn)**, I analyzed 2 years of retail data to segment customers based on:
* **Recency:** How recently they purchased?
* **Frequency:** How often they purchase?
* **Monetary:** How much they spend?

## Key Results
The model successfully identified 3 distinct customer personas:
1.  **VIP / Sultans:** High spenders who need exclusive service (Retention).
2.  **Loyal Customers:** Regular buyers with potential for upselling (Growth).
3.  **Hibernating:** Customers at risk of churning who need win-back campaigns (Recovery).

## Impact
By targeting these specific segments, businesses can potentially **increase retention** and **maximize ROI** on marketing campaigns.
